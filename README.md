I tend to switch browsers and operating systems and I also tend to bookmark websites over and over again. This script eliminates the duplicates and places the unique bookmarks into a new file that can be imported.

ToDo:
Add support for other browsers
Include options to allow the utility to clean out by domain level
Include placing items into individual folders based on domain.
Automating the entire process, to include halting iCloud backup until the process is finished.
and lots more when I think of it.

Export bookmarks via File > Export Bookmarks.



This has limited functionality, use at your own risk.
